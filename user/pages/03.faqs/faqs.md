            title: 'How do I start my own line of products?'
            body: "<p><strong>1) Begin with a CONCEPT</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2) Put it on PAPER </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>a. Product?</strong></p>\r\n<p>What type of product would you want to develop?</p>\r\n<p><strong>b. Positioning?</strong></p>\r\n<p>How will this product be different from others like it in the market?</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>c. Packaging?</strong></p>\r\n<p>In what size and material should the product be contained in?</p>\r\n<p><strong>3) Engage in PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT </strong></p>\r\n<p>a. Assessment</p>\r\n<p>b. Approval</p>\r\n<p>With CIANAN CORP's years of R&amp;D experience complemented by its network of resources, the company can help translate the product you have in mind into reality faster and more cost effectively. All you have to do is to assess the prototype samples/design concepts/packaging materials submitted and approve it once the product idea in mind has been achieved. After it has been approved, accelerated stability tests and product usage tests may be conducted to ascertain the product's longevity and effectiveness. Once these are done, you now have a mock-up of the product that was once just in your mind. It's now time to address the legal concerns.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4) Tackle the LEGAL aspects</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>a. FDA </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>b. IPO</strong></p>\r\n<p>Every consumer product that comes out in the market needs to be approved by FDA (Food and Drugs Administration). This is to ensure that the product you would want to sell is safe for public consumption. This process is called Product Notification which starts by completing all the required documents, submitting it to FDA, paying the required fees and waiting for the notification number to come out. Simultaneous to this, it is also advisable to register your brand name and logo with the trademark division of IPO (Intellectual Property Office) to make sure that no person or company has used or has a pending registration of the brand name you wanted. This will also guarantee that your brand name cannot be used anymore by persons or companies who may think of the same name after you have registered it. CIANAN CORP. can help you with registrations to both BFAD and IPO agencies. Once all these are in place, it's now time for you to write up your Purchase Order to have the actual products manufactured.</p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>5) Witness your first COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION</strong></p>\r\n<p>a. Write your Purchase Order</p>\r\n<p>b. Wait for delivery of your Finished Product</p>\r\n<p>A Purchase Order is a document that triggers the start of the production process on the part of the supply management firm such as CIANAN CORP. This starts with the procurement of all materials needed to produce the product in mind. Once all the materials have been delivered, actual production starts and the end result are the Finished Products which will then be delivered to your designated warehouse.</p>"

            title: 'How does CIANAN CORP. charge for its services?'
            body: "<p>CIANAN CORP. charges separately for its product development services and its manufacturing services. Fees for product development services are one-time and we call it PROJECT PROPOSAL. These include services fees for product formulation, packaging development (sourcing and design), stability tests and product registration.</p>\r\n<p>Manufacturing Service Fees, on the other hand, are based on the actual cost per unit of the end product which we call QUOTATION. The Quotation price may include raw materials, packaging materials, labor and delivery. The actual cost per unit is determined upon final approval of mock-up product which is the end result of the product development phase of the project. This is then multiplied with the order quantity and is payable upon order and delivery of the finished goods.</p>"
