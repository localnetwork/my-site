shortdesc: 'Stability testing is necessary to ensure the product is of acceptable quality throughout its entire storage period. Accelerated stability tests also known as normal or exploratory stability, has the objective of providing data to foresee the stability of the product, its useful life span, and the compatibility of the formulation with the containing material. This is done by subjecting product samples in a heating oven with temperature range up to 50Â°C for a period of 3 to 4.5 months which would approximately be equivalent to 2 and 3 years, respectively, should the product be left at normal room temperature. Generally, the parameters to be evaluated are as follows'

<p>Stability testing is necessary to ensure the product is of acceptable quality throughout its entire storage period. Accelerated stability tests also known as normal or exploratory stability, has the objective of providing data to foresee the stability of the product, its useful life span, and the compatibility of the formulation with the containing material. This is done by subjecting product samples in a heating oven with temperature range up to 50&deg;C for a period of 3 to 4.5 months which would approximately be equivalent to 2 and 3 years, respectively, should the product be left at normal room temperature. Generally, the parameters to be evaluated are as follows</p>
<p>a. Organoleptic parameters: appearance, color, odor and flavor, whenever applicable;</p>
<p>b. Physical-chemical parameters: pH value, viscosity, density, and in some cases, the monitoring of formulation ingredients;</p>
<p>c. Microbiological parameters: microbial count and challenge test of the preserving system.</p>
<p>These tests are applied in the development phase of the product on a laboratory scale and to pilot manufacturing batches and the test may be extended to cover the initial production. It can also be carried out whenever there are any significant alterations made to ingredients of the product and/or the manufacturing process, or to the containing material that comes into direct contact with the product, or in order to validate new equipment used for manufacturing the product.</p>
